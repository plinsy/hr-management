# Virtual Scrolling Fix - Show All Loaded Employees

## Problem
The calendar table was using virtual scrolling for employees, which caused:
1. **White space at top and bottom** - The container had a fixed height for all employees, but only rendered a subset
2. **Missing employees** - Previously loaded employees would disappear when scrolling
3. **Confusing UX** - As more employees loaded via infinite scroll, they weren't all visible

## Root Cause
The virtual scrolling implementation used `employeeVisibleRange` to calculate which employees to show based on scroll position:
- It would slice the employee array to only show employees in the viewport
- Employee rows used absolute positioning with calculated `top` values
- This created gaps (white space) and made previous employees invisible

## Solution
Removed virtual scrolling for employees while keeping it for date columns:

### Changes Made

1. **Removed `employeeVisibleRange` calculation**
   - Deleted the computed property that calculated visible employee range based on scroll position
   
2. **Updated `visibleEmployees` computed property**
   - Changed from: `employees.value.slice(employeeVisibleRange.startIndex, employeeVisibleRange.endIndex + 1)`
   - Changed to: `employees.value` (shows ALL loaded employees)

3. **Removed absolute positioning from employee rows**
   - Removed `position: 'absolute'` style
   - Removed calculated `top` value based on index
   - Rows now flow naturally in the DOM

4. **Removed fixed container height**
   - Removed `height: ${totalEmployeeHeight}px` from virtual-content
   - Container now grows naturally with loaded employees

5. **Updated watchers and logs**
   - Removed references to `employeeVisibleRange` in watchers
   - Simplified logging to reflect new behavior

6. **Removed unused import**
   - Removed `calculateVisibleRange` import (no longer needed)
   - Kept `calculateHorizontalVisibleRange` for date columns

## Benefits
- ✅ **All loaded employees are always visible** - No disappearing rows
- ✅ **No white space** - Container grows naturally with content
- ✅ **Smooth infinite scroll** - New employees append to the bottom seamlessly
- ✅ **Better UX** - Users can scroll through all loaded data
- ✅ **Maintained performance for dates** - Horizontal virtual scrolling still works for date columns

## Trade-offs
- For very large employee lists (1000+), performance may be impacted since all rows are rendered
- However, with infinite scroll loading 20 employees at a time, this is not a concern
- The DOM can handle 100-200 employee rows without noticeable performance degradation

## Virtual Scrolling Status
- ❌ **Employee rows**: Disabled (all loaded employees shown)
- ✅ **Date columns**: Still enabled (for horizontal scrolling in week view)

## Testing
Test the following scenarios:
1. Load initial 20 employees - all should be visible
2. Scroll to bottom to trigger infinite scroll
3. New employees should appear at the bottom (no white space)
4. Scroll back up - all previously loaded employees should still be visible
5. Continue loading until all 100 employees are loaded
6. Verify smooth scrolling through all employees
