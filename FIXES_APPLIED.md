# Fixes Applied to HRStream

## Issue: localStorage SSR Error (Fixed ✅)

### Problem
The application was throwing a `localStorage is not defined` error during server-side rendering (SSR) in Nuxt.

**Error Details:**
```
ReferenceError: localStorage is not defined
at initializeViewType (E:/interviews/hr-management/app/app.js:66:29)
```

### Root Cause
The code was trying to access `localStorage` during the setup phase of the Vue component, which runs on both the server (SSR) and the client. `localStorage` is only available in the browser environment, not on the Node.js server.

### Solution Applied
Added browser environment checks (`typeof window === 'undefined'`) before accessing `localStorage` in all four localStorage-related functions:

#### 1. `initializeSidebarState()`
```typescript
const initializeSidebarState = () => {
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') return  // ✅ Added check
  const savedRailState = localStorage.getItem('hr-sidebar-rail')
  if (savedRailState !== null) {
    rail.value = JSON.parse(savedRailState)
  }
}
```

#### 2. `saveSidebarState()`
```typescript
const saveSidebarState = (railState: boolean) => {
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') return  // ✅ Added check
  localStorage.setItem('hr-sidebar-rail', JSON.stringify(railState))
}
```

#### 3. `initializeViewType()`
```typescript
const initializeViewType = (): ViewType => {
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') return 'monthView'  // ✅ Added check with default
  const savedViewType = localStorage.getItem('hr-view-type')
  if (savedViewType && (savedViewType === 'monthView' || savedViewType === 'yearView')) {
    return savedViewType as ViewType
  }
  return 'monthView'
}
```

#### 4. `saveViewType()`
```typescript
const saveViewType = (viewTypeValue: ViewType) => {
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') return  // ✅ Added check
  localStorage.setItem('hr-view-type', viewTypeValue)
}
```

### Files Modified
- `app/app.vue` - Added SSR-safe localStorage access

### Verification
✅ Dev server starts successfully without errors  
✅ Application loads at http://localhost:3000/  
✅ No SSR-related errors in console  
✅ localStorage functionality works correctly in browser  

### Impact
- **Server-side:** Functions return default values/exit early, preventing errors
- **Client-side:** Full localStorage functionality works as expected
- **User experience:** No visible changes, just fixed the error

---

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The application now handles SSR correctly and works flawlessly in both server and client environments.
