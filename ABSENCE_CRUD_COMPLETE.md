# Absence Dialog - CRUD Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for the absence management dialog with enhanced user experience features.

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ 1. Cell Click Integration
**What was done:**
- Modified `CalendarTable.vue` to emit cell click events with employee, date, and absence data
- Updated `app.vue` to handle cell clicks and open the dialog appropriately
- Dialog now opens in CREATE mode for empty cells and EDIT mode for cells with absences

**User Experience:**
- Click any calendar cell to create or edit an absence
- Date is automatically pre-filled based on clicked cell
- Employee context is maintained from the table

### ✅ 2. Employee Search Feature
**What was done:**
- Added `v-autocomplete` component for searchable employee dropdown
- Implemented when no employee is selected from table click
- Shows employee name and personnel number in dropdown
- Displays avatar with initials for each employee

**User Experience:**
- Quick action "Add Absence" opens dialog with employee search
- Type to search by name or personnel number
- Clear employee selection and choose another

### ✅ 3. Enhanced Date Validation
**What was done:**
- Cross-field validation between start and end dates
- Real-time validation updates when either date changes
- Overlap detection with existing absences
- Year boundary validation (must be within 2025)

**Validation Rules:**
```
Start Date:
- Required
- Must be within 2025
- Must be ≤ end date

End Date:
- Required
- Must be within 2025
- Must be ≥ start date
- No overlaps with existing absences
```

**User Experience:**
- Immediate feedback when dates are invalid
- Clear error messages for each validation rule
- Prevents overlapping absences automatically
- Allows editing the same absence without triggering overlap error

### ✅ 4. Automatic Duration Calculation
**What was done:**
- Duration field displays calculated days between start and end dates
- Updates automatically when dates change
- Includes both start and end dates in calculation (inclusive)
- Read-only field with day suffix

**Calculation:**
```typescript
duration = daysDifference(startDate, endDate) + 1
```

**User Experience:**
- See duration instantly as you select dates
- No manual calculation needed
- Visual feedback on absence length

## Code Changes

### Modified Files

#### 1. `app/components/CalendarTable.vue`
```typescript
// Simplified cell click handler to always emit event
const handleCellClick = (employee: Employee, date: Date) => {
  const absence = getAbsenceForDate(employee.id, date)
  emit('cellClick', employee, date, absence)
}
```

#### 2. `app/components/AbsenceDialog.vue`
**Added:**
- Employee autocomplete dropdown
- Enhanced validation rules
- Duration calculation logic
- Date watchers for validation
- Employee search functionality

**Key Additions:**
```typescript
// Employee search
const selectedEmployeeId = ref<string | null>(null)
const allEmployees = computed(() => { ... })
const currentEmployee = computed(() => { ... })

// Enhanced validation
const employeeRules = [...]
const startDateRules = [...] // with cross-field validation
const endDateRules = [...] // with cross-field validation

// Watchers for real-time validation
watch(() => formData.value.startDate, () => { ... })
watch(() => formData.value.endDate, () => { ... })
```

#### 3. `app/app.vue`
```typescript
// Updated to allow null absence
const handleCellClick = (
  employee: Employee, 
  date: Date, 
  absence?: Absence | null
) => { ... }

// Updated quick action to open with search
const handleQuickAddAbsence = () => {
  absenceDialogData.value = {
    isOpen: true,
    employee: null, // Forces search
    selectedDate: new Date(),
    editingAbsence: null
  }
}
```

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite: `AbsenceDialog.enhanced.test.ts`

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Cell click integration (create/edit modes)
- ✅ Employee search functionality
- ✅ Date validation (all rules)
- ✅ Duration calculation (single/multiple days)
- ✅ Form submission validation
- ✅ Form initialization
- ✅ Overlap detection
- ✅ Auto-fill behavior

## Validation Examples

### Valid Scenarios ✅
```typescript
// Single day absence
startDate: '2025-03-15'

duration: 1 day

// Multi-day absence
startDate: '2025-03-15'
endDate: '2025-03-20'
duration: 6 days

// Editing without overlap
editing existing absence
same dates as original
```

### Invalid Scenarios ❌

❌ "End date must be after or equal to start date"

// Outside year
startDate: '2024-12-31'
❌ "Date must be within 2025"

// Overlapping
existing: Mar 10-15
new: Mar 12-18
